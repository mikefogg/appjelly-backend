# Testing Background Story Generation Flow

## 1. Job Queued Successfully ✅

```
Job ID: 70
Queue: content-generation
Artifact ID: dc9e3e19-de92-4ea9-85d0-4107adefab8d
Input ID: 9d07650f-b77e-42af-bb3b-fcd4204db91a
```

## 2. To Process the Job

In production or development, you would run the content worker:

```bash
# Development mode
npm run content-worker-dev

# Or production mode  
npm run content-worker
```

## 3. What the Worker Will Do

When the content worker processes this job, it will:

1. **Load the artifact** with input and actors
2. **Update status** to "generating" 
3. **Generate character JSON** from the 4 actors
4. **Create plotline** using the markdown template + GPT-4o mini
5. **Generate story** using plotline + markdown template + GPT-4o mini
6. **Save to database**:
   - Update artifact with title, subtitle, description
   - Store token usage (total: ~3700 tokens)
   - Store cost (~$0.0011) 
   - Store generation time (~25 seconds)
   - Create 11 ArtifactPage records with text arrays and image prompts
7. **Update status** to "completed"

## 4. Monitor Progress

You can monitor the artifact status:

```bash
dev node scripts/monitor-artifact-status.js dc9e3e19-de92-4ea9-85d0-4107adefab8d
```

## 5. Verify Results

After processing, the artifact will have:
- ✅ Title: "Ava's Donut Adventure"
- ✅ Subtitle: "A magical journey for the perfect donut"
- ✅ 11 story pages with text arrays
- ✅ Image prompts for each page
- ✅ Complete token tracking
- ✅ Cost and timing data

## 6. Background vs Direct Comparison

**Direct Generation (scripts/generate-story-from-artifact.js):**
- Runs immediately in current process
- Good for testing/debugging
- Blocks until complete

**Background Job (scripts/queue-story-generation.js):**
- Queues job for worker to process
- Non-blocking, scalable
- How it works in production
- Allows for retry logic, monitoring, etc.

The background job approach is what the actual mobile app uses when users create stories!
