# Ghost API - Functionality Map

This document maps the current API functionality against the required user flows.

## ✅ 1. Authentication with Clerk

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**How it works**:
- Authentication is handled via `requireAuth` middleware (`src/middleware/auth.js:5`)
- Client sends request with Clerk JWT token in Authorization header
- Middleware validates token using `@clerk/express` SDK
- Account is auto-created if doesn't exist (fetches user data from Clerk API)
- Account is stored in `res.locals.account` for downstream use

**Required headers**:
```
Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt_token>
X-App-Slug: ghost
```

**Middleware chain**: `requireAppContext` → `requireAuth`

---

## ✅ 2. Add a New Network (Twitter, etc.)

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint**: `POST /oauth/:platform/connect`

**Implementation**: `src/routes/public/oauth.js`

**Supported Platforms**:
- ✅ Twitter/X
- ✅ Facebook (Instagram/Threads)
- ✅ LinkedIn

**How it works**:
```
POST /oauth/twitter/connect
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>
  X-App-Slug: ghost
Body: {
  "access_token": "user_oauth_token",
  "refresh_token": "refresh_token", // optional
  "expires_in": 7200 // optional
}

→ Validates access token with platform API
→ Fetches user profile (username, display name, etc.)
→ Encrypts tokens with AES-256-GCM
→ Creates ConnectedAccount record
→ Triggers background sync job
→ Returns connection details
```

**Response** (201 Created):
```json
{
  "code": 201,
  "status": "Success",
  "message": "Successfully connected account",
  "data": {
    "connection": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "platform": "twitter",
      "username": "yourusername",
      "display_name": "Your Name",
      "sync_status": "pending"
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Features**:
- ✅ Tokens encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage
- ✅ Duplicate connection prevention
- ✅ User ownership validation
- ✅ Platform API verification

**Database fields** (`connected_accounts` table):
- `platform`: "twitter" | "facebook" | "linkedin"
- `platform_user_id`: Platform user ID
- `username`: @handle or display name
- `access_token`: OAuth token (encrypted)
- `refresh_token`: OAuth refresh token (encrypted)
- `token_expires_at`: Token expiration timestamp
- `sync_status`: "pending" | "syncing" | "ready" | "error"
- `is_active`: true | false (for soft deletes)

**React Native Integration**: See `REACT_NATIVE_OAUTH_GUIDE.md` for complete expo-auth-session examples

---

## ✅ 3. Remove a Network (Twitter, etc.)

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /connections/:id`

**Implementation**: `src/routes/public/connections.js:176`

**How it works**:
```
DELETE /connections/{connection_id}
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>
  X-App-Slug: ghost

→ Soft deletes by setting is_active = false
→ Does not delete historical data
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "Success",
  "message": "Connection disconnected successfully",
  "data": {
    "message": "Connection disconnected successfully"
  }
}
```

**Security**:
- Validates connection belongs to authenticated user
- Validates connection belongs to current app

---

## ✅ 4. Fetch Most Recent Suggested Content for Twitter

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint**: `GET /suggestions`

**Implementation**: `src/routes/public/suggestions.js:16`

**How it works**:
```
GET /suggestions?connected_account_id={uuid}

  ]
}
```

**New Response Fields**:
- `angle`: The writing angle used (hot_take, roast, hype, story, teach, question)
- `length`: The target length (short, medium, long)
- `expires_at`: Timestamp when suggestion becomes "stale" (24 hours from creation)

**Filters applied**:
- `status = "pending"` (not used/dismissed)

- All suggestions returned regardless of age (client can filter by expires_at if desired)

**Additional suggestion endpoints**:
- `GET /suggestions/:id` - Get specific suggestion details
- `POST /suggestions/:id/use` - Mark suggestion as used
- `POST /suggestions/:id/dismiss` - Mark suggestion as dismissed
- `POST /suggestions/:id/generate-response` - Generate AI reply (with angle/length) ✅
- `POST /suggestions/generate` - Manually trigger generation (unlimited) ✅
- `GET /suggestions/reply-opportunities` - Get top engaging posts to reply to ✅
- `POST /suggestions/:id/regenerate` - ❌ Not implemented (501 status)

**Automated Suggestion Generation**:
- ✅ Hourly automatic generation for all eligible accounts
- ✅ Two-path system: Network-based (Twitter/LinkedIn) vs Interest-based (Ghost)
- ✅ Incremental data fetching (only new posts since last sync)
- ✅ Each suggestion gets a randomly assigned `angle` and `length` for variety
- ✅ Suggestions include extracted topics (1-3 main themes)

## ✅ 6c. Manual Suggestion Generation (Unlimited)

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint**: `POST /suggestions/generate`

**Implementation**: `src/routes/public/suggestions.js:421`

**How it works**:
```
POST /suggestions/generate
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>
  X-App-Slug: ghost
Body: {
  "connected_account_id": "uuid"
}

→ For ghost platform: Checks topics_of_interest exists
→ For network platforms: Checks sync_status = "ready"
→ Queues suggestion generation job (no rate limiting)
→ Returns 202 Accepted with polling instructions
→ Generates 3 new suggestions with random angle/length for each
```

**Response** (202 Accepted):
```json
{
  "code": 202,
  "status": "Success",
  "data": {
    "message": "Suggestion generation queued",
    "generation_started_at": "2025-10-20T12:00:00.000Z",
    "polling_instructions": {
      "poll_endpoint": "/suggestions?connected_account_id=xxx",
      "check_for_suggestions_created_after": "2025-10-20T12:00:00.000Z",
      "estimated_completion_seconds": 15,
      "recommended_poll_interval_ms": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

**Frontend Polling Pattern**:
```typescript
// 1. Call generate endpoint
const response = await fetch('/suggestions/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ connected_account_id: 'xxx' })
});
const { data } = await response.json();
const startedAt = data.generation_started_at;

// 2. Poll every 2 seconds
const interval = setInterval(async () => {
  const suggestions = await fetch('/suggestions?connected_account_id=xxx');
  const newOnes = suggestions.filter(s => new Date(s.created_at) > new Date(startedAt));

  if (newOnes.length > 0) {
    clearInterval(interval);
    // Update UI with new suggestions
  }
}, 2000);

// 3. Timeout after 30 seconds
setTimeout(() => clearInterval(interval), 30000);
```

**Ghost Platform Requirements**:
- Must have either `topics_of_interest` OR `sample_posts`
- If only sample posts exist, topics will be auto-inferred using AI
- If neither exists, returns error asking user to add one or the other

**Network Platform Requirements**:
- Must have `sync_status = "ready"`
- Connection must be fully synced
- Returns error if not ready

  Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>
  X-App-Slug: ghost
Body: {
  "prompt": "Write a tweet about AI safety",
  "angle": "hot_take",
  "length": "medium",
  "connected_account_id": "uuid"
}

→ Creates Input record with angle/length metadata
→ Creates Artifact record (status: "pending")
→ Queues background job (generate-post)
→ AI generates post using voice, sample posts, and writing style
→ Platform-specific character limits applied automatically
→ Returns 202 Accepted immediately
```

**Request validation**:
- `prompt`: 1-500 characters, required
- `angle`: enum, required - How to approach the topic
  - `"hot_take"` - Bold, controversial opinion
  - `"roast"` - Playful, witty criticism
  - `"hype"` - Enthusiastic excitement and promotion
  - `"story"` - Compelling narrative or experience
  - `"teach"` - Explain or teach something valuable
  - `"question"` - Thought-provoking question
- `length`: enum, required - Post length target
  - `"short"` - Quick hits, memes, CTAs (high engagement)
  - `"medium"` - Insights, questions (peak engagement)
  - `"long"` - Deep dives, thought leadership
- `connected_account_id`: UUID, **optional** (uses ghost account if omitted)
- If provided, connection must have `sync_status = "ready"`

**Platform-Specific Character Limits**:
- **Twitter**: short=100, medium=280, long=5000 (Premium)
- **LinkedIn**: short=150, medium=600, long=2000
- **Threads**: short=100, medium=300, long=500
- **Facebook**: short=80, medium=400, long=2000
- **Ghost** (default): short=100, medium=300, long=2000

**Response** (202 Accepted):
```json
{
  "code": 202,
  "status": "Success",
  "data": {
    "id": "artifact_uuid",
    "status": "pending",
    "message": "Post generation queued",
    "input": {
      "id": "input_uuid",
      "prompt": "Write a tweet about AI safety"
    }
  }
}
```

**Polling for completion**:
```
GET /posts/{artifact_id}

→ Returns artifact with status: "pending" | "completed" | "failed"
→ Once completed, includes generated content
```

**Complete post response**:
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "Success",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "status": "completed",
    "content": "AI safety is crucial because... #AI #safety",
    "character_count": 280,
    "angle": "hot_take",
    "length": "medium",
    "topics": ["AI safety", "Technology"],
    "input": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "prompt": "Write a tweet about AI safety"
    },
    "connected_account": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "platform": "twitter",
      "username": "yourusername"
    },
    "generation_info": {
      "total_tokens": 150,
      "cost_usd": 0.0015,
      "generation_time_seconds": 2.5,
      "ai_model": "gpt-4"
    },
    "created_at": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-14T10:00:02Z"
  }
}
```

**New Response Fields**:
- `angle`: The writing angle used (hot_take, roast, hype, story, teach, question)
- `length`: The target length (short, medium, long)
- `topics`: Array of 1-3 main topics extracted from the content by AI

**Generation Customization with Voice & Sample Posts**:

The AI generation uses the following **optional** data to personalize content:
1. **Voice**: Custom writing voice description from the connected account
2. **Sample Posts**: Example posts that demonstrate the user's tone and style
3. **Writing Style**: Auto-analyzed style from synced posts (tone, emoji frequency, etc.)

All three are optional enhancements that improve personalization but are not required.

When a `connected_account_id` is provided, the AI will:
- Use the account's custom `voice` field in the system prompt if set
- Include `sample_posts` as examples to match tone and style if provided
- Apply auto-detected `writing_style` preferences if available
- Apply platform-specific character limits based on the account's platform

See "Customize Writing Voice & Sample Posts" section below for managing these optional settings.

**Additional post endpoints**:
- `GET /posts` - List all generated posts (paginated)
- `GET /posts?type=draft|generated|all` - Filter posts by type
- `GET /posts/:id` - Get specific post
- `PATCH /posts/:id` - Edit post content
- `POST /posts/:id/improve` - Get AI improvement suggestions (preview-only)
- `POST /posts/:id/copy` - Mark post as copied to clipboard
- `DELETE /posts/:id` - Delete post

---

## ✅ 8. Customize Writing Voice & Sample Posts

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Overview**: Users can customize how the AI generates content by setting a custom writing voice and providing sample posts. Both are optional enhancements - the AI will work without them, but they help personalize the output. These settings are stored per connected account.

### Update Writing Voice

**Endpoint**: `PATCH /connections/:id`

**Implementation**: `src/routes/public/connections.js:182`

**How it works**:
```
PATCH /connections/{connection_id}
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>
  X-App-Slug: ghost
Body: {
  "voice": "Write like a tech entrepreneur. Be concise, inspiring, and forward-thinking. Use metaphors from startups and innovation.",
  "topics_of_interest": "AI and technology, startup culture, product design"
}

→ Updates voice and/or topics_of_interest fields
→ AI uses these in future content generation
→ Maximum 2000 characters each
```

**Request validation**:
- `voice`: String, 1-2000 characters, optional
- `topics_of_interest`: String, 1-2000 characters, optional (for ghost platform)
- Connection must belong to authenticated user
- Connection must belong to current app

**Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "Success",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "platform": "ghost",
    "username": "My Drafts",
    "voice": "Write like a tech entrepreneur. Be concise, inspiring, and forward-thinking. Use metaphors from startups and innovation.",
    "topics_of_interest": "AI and technology, startup culture, product design",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-19T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Topics of Interest (Ghost Platform)**:
- Used for generating suggestions when there's no network to analyze
- Can be set manually OR auto-inferred from sample posts via AI
- If you have sample posts but no topics, AI will automatically infer and save topics during suggestion generation
- Optional if you provide sample posts (topics will be generated automatically)
- If neither topics nor sample posts exist, user must add one or the other before generating suggestions

**Clear fields**: Send `{"voice": null}` or `{"voice": ""}` to clear

### Filter Posts by Type

**Endpoint**: `GET /posts?type=draft|generated|all`

**Implementation**: `src/routes/public/posts.js:165`

**How it works**:
```
GET /posts?type=draft
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>
  X-App-Slug: ghost

→ Returns only user-written drafts (no input_id)
→ Excludes AI-generated posts
```

**Query parameters**:
- `type`: "draft" | "generated" | "all" (default: "all")
- `connected_account_id`: UUID or "none", optional filter
  - **If UUID**: Returns posts for that specific connected account
  - **If "none"**: Returns only standalone posts (no connected account)
  - **If omitted**: Returns all posts for the user
- `sort`: "created_at" | "updated_at" (default: "created_at")
- `order`: "asc" | "desc" (default: "desc")
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `per_page`: Results per page (default: 20, max: 50)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "Success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "status": "draft",
      "content": "User-written content",
      "character_count": 21,
      "is_draft": true,
      "input": null,
      "connected_account": {
        "id": "uuid",
        "platform": "twitter",
        "username": "yourusername"
      },
      "created_at": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-10-14T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "per_page": 20,
      "has_more": false
    },
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

**Draft vs Generated**:
- **Drafts**: `input_id` is null, `status` is "draft", user-written
- **Generated**: `input_id` exists, created from AI prompt
- Both can be edited with `PATCH /posts/:id`
- Both can be improved with `POST /posts/:id/improve`

**Standalone vs Connected Posts**:
- **Standalone**: `connected_account_id` is null - created before connecting any social accounts
- **Connected**: `connected_account_id` links to a specific platform account
- Both types support drafts AND generated posts
- Use `GET /posts?connected_account_id=none` to fetch only standalone posts
- Useful for onboarding flow where users start writing before connecting accounts

- ✅ Facebook (for Instagram/Threads)
- ✅ LinkedIn

### Connect Account Flow

**Endpoint**: `POST /oauth/:platform/connect`

**Platforms**: `twitter`, `facebook`, `linkedin`

**How it works**:
```
POST /oauth/twitter/connect

## ✅ 7. Account Management & Deletion

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /accounts/me`

**Implementation**: `src/routes/public/accounts.js:157`

**How it works**:
```
DELETE /accounts/me
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>
  X-App-Slug: ghost

→ Soft deletes account (sets metadata.deleted_at)
→ Disconnects all connected social accounts
→ Returns subscription notice
→ Data retained for compliance/audit purposes
```

**Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "Success",
  "data": {
    "message": "Account deleted successfully",
    "disconnected_platforms": 2,
    "subscription_notice": "Please note: We cannot automatically cancel your subscription. Please manage your subscription through your payment provider (App Store, Google Play, or Stripe)."
  }
}
```

**What happens on deletion**:
- ✅ Account soft deleted (metadata.deleted_at timestamp added)
- ✅ All connected accounts deactivated (is_active = false)
- ✅ Disconnection timestamps added to each platform
- ✅ Data retained for compliance (no hard delete)
- ✅ User notified to manually cancel subscription

**Additional account endpoints**:
- `GET /accounts/me` - Get current account details
- `PATCH /accounts/me` - Update account metadata
- `POST /accounts/me/regenerate-display-name` - Regenerate display name

## 📝 Notes

- All endpoints require `X-App-Slug: ghost` header
- All endpoints require Clerk JWT in `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 format
- UUIDs are used for all IDs
- Background jobs use BullMQ (ghostQueue)
- Writing style analysis happens automatically after sync
- Suggestions have an `expires_at` timestamp (24 hours from creation) to mark them as "stale"
- All suggestions are returned regardless of age; client decides filtering based on `expires_at`
- Suggestion status only reflects user actions: `pending`, `used`, or `dismissed`
